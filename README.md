# Hey :) — I’m Angeliki Spanou-Kapantoni

Electrical & Computer Engineering final-year student (NTUA) focused on **Machine Learning + Software Engineering**, with hands-on experience building **reproducible ML pipelines** and **production-style systems**.

I enjoy working on problems at the intersection of **data, graphs, and scalable software** — from experimentation to deployment.
